#TwigJS Build
A build repository for [TwigJS](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js)

####Why a separate repo for build?
*As stated from the twigjs [wiki](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/wiki#download):*
>The files twig.js and twig.min.js may not be up-to-date (they will be rebuilt when releasing a new version). Run make (or make -B to force building) to create these files.
